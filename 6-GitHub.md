# GitHub

Kind of like Myspace, Linkedin, the library, and a playground for developers.  

At the beginning you'll be doing a lot of your writing and collaborating directly from GitHub.  When you're more advanced you'll be able to collaborate using Git directly from your Terminal.  This is when you start to feel cool.

This page outlines the key features of GitHub we'll be using in the first module of Hack Your Future.

## What is Github

There are soooo many good answers to this question on the web, let us know if we forgot one!

* [in their own words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)
* [in codebasics' words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9IAquDsDg)

## Using Markdown

A very simple [markup language](https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-markup-languages-3468655) for making beautiful documents.  The syntax is simple and there isn't very much of it.

You'll be using markdown _all the time_. For checking in homework, for writing homework, for taking notes, for documenting code, for ever.

## Using Github Wikis

In order to submit homework in the class wiki, you will need to learn these things:
* [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet): Markdown is a very simple programming language that makes things look pretty. This precourse was written in Markdown. Unless you really want to make your entry pretty, all you'll need to learn is hyper links and bullet points.
* Editing GitHub wikis:  Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-ViPwseACM), and an [article](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-wiki-pages-via-the-online-interface/).  Both are good, use the one that helps you most.
* Our [homework checkoff system](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/homework-checkoff-tables/).
* and [emojis](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908).

## Forking a Repository

This is when you make a copy of someone's project on your account, when you make changes on your copy they won't show up on the original copy (unless you ask nicely).  You'll get plenty of practice with this.

* [github help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)

## Pull Requests

This is a tricky thing to get at first, but once you get it it becomes natural.  You'll get a lot of practice with this as you complete and turn in your homeworks.

## Github Pages

When you put Markdown or {HTML, CSS & JavaScript} in a repository GitHub can automatically run it as a website.  Hack Your Future Belgium's website is hosted like this:
* [our live website](https://hackyourfuture.be)
* [it's source code repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/HackYourFutureBelgium.github.io)

* [github's own intro](https://help.github.com/en/categories/github-pages-basics)
* [a thinkful intro](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/)

## Git Clients

The hardest part to learn about working with GitHub is using the terminal on your computer.  Until you've mastered that __Git Clients__ are the best way to start pulling & pushing code between your computer and GitHub. 

Git Clients are desktop applications like Word or Power Point that are designed to make it easier to interact with GitHub.  You can save your work to GitHub, pull your work from GitHub, make copies of other people's code, all with the click of a button. 

These applications can be a bit confusing at first, but they're worlds easier than working from terminal.  Even  professional developers use them, it's not cheating!

_GitHub Desktop_ (only for windows and mac)
* [installation instructions](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)
* [it's home page](https://desktop.github.com)
* [the source code, for fun](https://github.com/desktop/desktop)

_GitKraken_ (mac, linux, windows)
* [GitKraken home page (download)](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
* [GitKraken tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9GfRziCtU)

_ungit_ (mac, linux, windows)
* this one is a bit trickier to get started with. It requires Node.js and is used from the terminal, but once you figure it out it's very simple to use

## Pulling and Pushing

GitHub is great for sharing your code, and your computer is great for writing code.  But how do you get your work back and forth without copy pasting?  With Pulls and Pushes!

## Using Git in Terminal

This is the hardest part of all and can take many months to master.  We recommend you don't jump into this right away, instead check out these resources first:

* [learngitbranching.js.org](http://learngitbranching.js.org/)
* [git, the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [and iff you must ...](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=git+for+ages+4+and+up&t=osx&ia=videos&iax=videos&iai=1ffBJ4sVUb4)
