# Hack Your Future BE Precourse

The main objective for this precourse is to get you ready for what's coming in your next 6 months, and to e-meet each other before the first day of class.  The focus of your assignments will be on using GitHub and homework workflow so you can focus on the cool stuff from day 1.

## Slack

Install the Slack Apps on your:
- Mobile: [App store](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack&hl=nl)
- Desktop: [OSX](https://slack.com/downloads/osx) or [Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows)


Be active on slack!  This is how you'll start meeting and helping each other before the class starts. Once you are in, join the channel #classN and write "hej ðŸ‘‹". (If your classnumber is 9 the Slack channel will be called #class9).


We also ask you not to use fake names - as you will use this channel for advice and feedback it will be helpful if your mentors know who is who. Adding a photo to your profile is _required_ :)
