## Browsers

So far in your life, you have probably used your browser to troll the web and look at cats.  In our course you will learn to use your browser to edit, test, inspect, and debug code.  Any browser is fine for trolling, but not all browsers have the tools you need to develop.

## VSC

If you have no experience or preference between text editors just install Visual studio. You can always switch to another editor later on in the program, and students in the past have really enjoyed Visual Studio Code.  It's also easier to help each other when you're all using the same editor.

## GitKraken

The hardest part to learn about working with GitHub is using the terminal on your computer.  Until you've mastered that __Git Clients__ are the best way to start pulling & pushing code between your computer and GitHub. 

Git Clients are desktop applications like Word or Power Point that are designed to make it easier to interact with GitHub.  You can save your work to GitHub, pull your work from GitHub, make copies of other people's code, all with the click of a button. 

Even professional developers use GitKraken, it's not cheating!

## Terminal 

All computers already come with a terminal, the application that lets you communicate  directly with your computer. Usually when you want to open or edit a file you'll do it by clicking on icons and working in applications. With terminal, you can do all of these things by typing commands directly into the computer.  This will be necessary for running most developer tools, for more efficient file navigation, and for using git (once you've outgrown GitHub Desktop).

If you have a mac or Linux machine there is nothing to install, it's all there.

If you are on a Windows machine you've got a little extra work.  Most of the dev tools for web development don't play well with Windows machines.  You could spend time each week fighting this and making each tool work individually ... or you could install:
* [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org)  
  
Or better yet:
* [Linux](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot).  
If you have a Windows machine, you can fix all of your problems at once by installing Linux.

## Node

Install this and forget about it for now, we'll cover it in detail later in the course.

## Live-Server

This simple-to-use devtool will save you lots of time while developing HTML/CSS projects in the first module.  Every time you make a change in your code editor, your browser will automatically update to show your changes.

* [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)

If that website is a bit overwhelming, here's the one line answer:
* type ```npm install -g live-server``` into your terminal (or gitbash if you do windows)
